Recursion in C language refers to the technique of defining a function that calls itself as a subroutine.
When a function calls itself, it creates a new instance of itself on the stack, 
and execution continues from that point. This process can repeat multiple times,
creating a chain of function calls that are executed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.
