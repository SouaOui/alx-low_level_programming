# C Programming Repository Readme

This repository contains code in C language through my journey on ALX Learn the basics of C programming. It includes examples and exercises that cover various topics, including the program flow, variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, pointers, arrays, strings, and standard functions in string.h.

# Program Flow

During </the preprocessor stage/>, the preprocessor handles directives such as #include and #define. The #include directive is used to include header files, which are used to declare functions and macros that are used in the program. The #define directive is used to define constants or macros.

During </the compilation stage/>, the compiler translates the source code into object code. The object code is machine language code that can be executed by the computer's processor.

During </the assembly stage/>, the assembler converts the object code into machine code. Machine code is the binary code that the computer's processor can understand and execute.

During </the linking stage/>, the linker links object code with other object code and libraries to create an executable file. Libraries are collections of precompiled code that can be reused in different programs.
